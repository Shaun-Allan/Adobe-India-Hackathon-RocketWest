# RocketWest Submission -- Adobe India Hackathon (Connecting the Dots)

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure

This repo contains code and solution approaches for two major challenges:

| Directory         | Content Summary |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `Challenge_1a/`   | Core PDF processing and structured data extraction. Dockerized pipeline for parsing and organizing PDF section hierarchy efficiently. See the folder for a detailed README with setup and usage instructions. |
| `Challenge_1b/`   | Advanced persona-based content analysis across multiple document collectionsâ€”focused on cross-document intelligence, contextual linking, and multi-source insights. Check the folder for a detailed README covering the implementation and use cases. |

### Challenge 1a â€” Core PDF Processing

- Extracts outlines and structure from raw PDFs.
- Implements clean, modular pipeline for **fast parsing** and **section hierarchy identification**.
- Suitable for adapting into on-device intelligence modules or scalable backend processing.
- Includes Docker configuration for easy deployment.

*Go to `Challenge_1a/` to explore the code, detailed documentation, and deployment steps.*

### Challenge 1b â€” Multi-Collection Analysis

- Builds on 1a by analyzing multiple PDF collections.
- Showcases persona-based content recommendations (contextual insights tailored to user profile/intent).
- Demonstrates semantic linking across **multiple** documents, not just within a single PDF.
- Extendable for building recommendation engines or advanced digital library assistants.

*Navigate to `Challenge_1b/` for detailed explanations, walkthroughs, and demos.*
